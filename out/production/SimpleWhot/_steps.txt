Some error after choosing suit for wild card, or hold on card. It hangs in at input waiting.
possible solutions:
- follow flow to see if there is anything obvious causing bug. (If nothing found see next solution.)
- recode way of repeating current active player's turn using flags instead of calling
chooseMove again.
- code gets stuck in while loop in "chooseMove" because of activeTurnPlayed field:
  activeTurnPlayed is false and so code is stuck in chooseMove while loop and can't escape.
  figure out how this happens and how to fix.


Write up code for suspension special action.

Write up code for other special actions:
-PickThree
-AnyOne
-PickTwo
-WildCard
-HoldOn
-Go General Market


Setup computer to play automatically.



Done ======>
Create Dictionary to hold special cards and their effect (or effect code?)
If first center card is the wild card play next card in deck on top of it.
Print out info of card played (before special action)...
