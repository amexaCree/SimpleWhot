1.
CHECK THAT CARD IS PLAYABLE
player should CHOOSE card before it is removed to
allow card to be checked for VALID MOVE before it is
played (and removed from players hand and added to table)

2.
Would be nice to have a function players could call
to arrange the card in their hand grouping similar
cards and ordering then in ascending or ascending depending on group

3.
computer could be a modified player class

4.
hand, table can also be modified whot decks

5.
could make a resuable method for getting user options
that takes and array or range of the possible option ints
