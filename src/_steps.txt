Some error after choosing suit for wild card, or hold on card. It hangs in at input waiting.
possible solutions:
- follow flow to see if there is anything obvious causing bug. (If nothing found see next solution.)
- recode way of repeating current active player's turn using flags instead of calling
chooseMove again.
- code gets stuck in while loop in "chooseMove" because of activeTurnPlayed field:
  activeTurnPlayed is false and so code is stuck in chooseMove while loop and can't escape.
  figure out how this happens and how to fix.
